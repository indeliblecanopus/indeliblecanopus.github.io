Google Workspace Add-on to help you translate SpotifyÂ® album tracks and search within the artist's translated discography. 

## Premise

I often search Spotify, trying to find new Jazz artists to listen to and often need to look through the artist's albums,
trying to quickly spot familiar standards. However, many artists list their track names in different languages, plus copy-pasting track names into translation service seems quite a time waste, so decided to build this small add-on. 

## Features
